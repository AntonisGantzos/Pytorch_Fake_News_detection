# Fake news detection with Pytorch
# Project Overview
  This project demonstrates the use of a simple Neural Network for fake news detection using PyTorch. The goal is to classify news articles as either fake or real based on their content.

# Key Components
  - Data Preprocessing: Includes loading and preparing the dataset, which consists of labeled news articles.
  - Model Building: Constructs a PyTorch-based Neural Network for text classification.
  - Training & Evaluation: Trains the model on the dataset and evaluates its performance.
  
# How to Use
  - Clone the repository.
  - Install dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
  - Run the notebook for training and evaluation.
    
# Prerequisites
  - Python 3.x
  - PyTorch
  - Jupyter Notebook
    
# Learning Outcomes
  By completing this project, users will understand how to implement text classification models using PyTorch.
