Context-Free Grammar (CFG):
Use the same CFG provided in the previous assignment. The symbol | means the logical "OR":

S → NP VP
NP → Det N
VP → V NP | V
Det → "a" | "the"
N → "cat" | "dog" | "fish"
V → "sees" | "likes" | "eats"
Task:
Construct parse trees for the following strings, which are valid - only the valid:

"the dog sees a cat"
"likes the fish"
"a cat eats"
"the dog the fish"
"sees a fish"


Instructions:
For each string, draw a parse tree.
Start with the start symbol S and expand using the production rules to form the given string.
Clearly label each node in the tree with the corresponding grammar rule.
Ensure the tree correctly represents the syntactic structure of the string according to the CFG.


Submission:
Submit your parse trees as diagrams or drawings, either digitally created or hand-drawn and scanned, for each of the strings.



Grading Criteria:
Correctness: Each tree must accurately represent the structure of the given string according to the CFG.
Completeness: All nodes and branches of the tree must be present and correctly labeled.
Clarity: Trees should be easy to read and understand, with clear labels and a neat structure.
