Objective:
To practice applying the rules of a context-free grammar to determine if specific strings are valid productions of that grammar.



Context-Free Grammar (CFG):
Provided below is a context-free grammar. This CFG is designed to generate simple sentences or strings. The symbol | means the logical "OR".



S → NP VP
NP → Det N
VP → V NP | V
Det → "a" | "the"
N → "cat" | "dog" | "fish"
V → "sees" | "likes" | "eats"


Where S is the start symbol, NP is a noun phrase, VP is a verb phrase, Det is a determiner, N is a noun, and V is a verb.



Task:
Your task is to determine whether the following strings are valid according to the provided CFG. For each string, explain your reasoning based on the grammar's production rules.

"the dog sees a cat"
"likes the fish"
"a cat eats"
"the dog the fish"
"sees a fish"


Instructions:
Analyze each string based on the CFG provided.
Determine if the string can be derived from the start symbol (S) using the production rules.
Explain your reasoning for each string, showing which rules apply or why a string cannot be derived.


Submission:
Submit your analysis and explanations for each of the five strings in a written document.



Grading Criteria:
Accuracy: Correctly identifying valid and invalid strings.
Explanation: Clarity and correctness in the explanation of how the strings do or do not conform to the CFG.
Understanding of CFG: Demonstrating a thorough understanding of how CFGs work.
